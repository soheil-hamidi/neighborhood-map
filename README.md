### To run the application:

please install `npm install http-server -g` and go to project directory and run
`http-server` on terminal or any CLI. Visit `http://localhost:8080/` and you should
be able to see the app. (You need to have node and npm installed on your machine)

The other alternative is to get `atom-live-server` for atom editor and run the app
that way.

The app is using Zomato and Foursquare API for list of restaurants and the red
information button on the top right hand of the website mentions this too.
