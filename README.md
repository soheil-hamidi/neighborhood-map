### To run the application:

please install `npm install http-server -g` and go to project directory and run
`http-server` on terminal or any CLI. Visit `http://localhost:8080/` and you should
be able to see the app. (You need to have node and npm installed on your machine)

The other alternative is to get `atom-live-server` for atom editor and run the app
that way.

Or you can check out this link to see the app running.
